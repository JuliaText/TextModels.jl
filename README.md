## Introduction

The TextModels package enhances the TextAnalysis package with end-user focussed, practical natural language models, typically based on neural networks (in this case, [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/)).  Please see the [documentation](https://juliahub.com/docs/TextModels) for more.

- **License** : [MIT License](https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

## Installation

```julia
pkg> add TextModels
```

Some of the models require data files to run, which are downloaded on demand. Therefore, internet access is required at runtime for certain functionality in this package.
